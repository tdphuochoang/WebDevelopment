        <h2 id="raven">The Raven</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Deep into that darkness peering,<br /><br />
          Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,<br /><br />
          Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals<br /><br />
          Ever dared to dream before;<br /><br />
          But the silence was unbroken,<br /><br />
          And the stillness gave no token,<br /><br />
          And the only word there spoken<br /><br />
          Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"<br /><br />
          This I whispered, and an echo<br /><br />
          Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"<br /><br />
          Merely this, and nothing more.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h2 id="colossus">The New Colossus</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride
          from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A
          mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning,
          and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide
          welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities
          frame. “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she With silent
          lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to
          breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these,
          the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden
          door!”<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h2 id="death">Because I could not stop for Death</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Because I could not stop for Death,<br /><br />
          He kindly stopped for me;<br /><br />
          The carriage held but just ourselves<br /><br />
          And Immortality.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h2 id="sonnet">Sonnet 18</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? Thou art more lovely and more
          temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer’s
          lease hath all too short a date; Sometime too hot the eye of heaven
          shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; And every fair from
          fair sometime declines, By chance or nature’s changing course
          untrimm'd; But thy eternal summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession
          of that fair thou ow’st; Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his
          shade, When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st: So long as men can
          breathe or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to
          thee.<br /><br />

        <h2 id="khan">Kubla Khan</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          And all should cry, Beware! Beware!<br /><br />
          His flashing eyes, his floating hair!<br /><br />
          Weave a circle round him thrice,<br /><br />
          And close your eyes with holy dread<br /><br />
          For he on honey-dew hath fed,<br /><br />
          And drunk the milk of Paradise.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h2 id="coming">The Second Coming</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br /><br />
          The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br /><br />
          Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br /><br />
          Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br /><br />
          The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br /><br />
          The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br /><br />
          The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br /><br />
          Are full of passionate intensity.<br /><br />
